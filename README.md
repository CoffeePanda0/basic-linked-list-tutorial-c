# basic-linked-list-tutorial-c

A very basic introduction on using linked lists in C, documented and commented for beginners.
Code can be found in example.c, and compiled by using gcc, or your favourite C compiler.

At the moment this only shows, creating, deleting and printing from the front of a list, but I'll probably add more examples in the future if this becomes popular
